## Overview

This repository contains the final explainable decision-support pipeline for detecting candidate Mirror Movements (MM) in bilateral wrist accelerometer recordings collected during the Box and Blocks Test (BBT).

The package analyzes one patient at a time. It does not implement a UCP-vs-TD classifier as its final output. Instead, it highlights short windows compatible with MM and attaches event-level explanations based on clinically interpretable signal features.

The workflow is designed for technical review and clinical validation: detections are candidate events, not standalone diagnoses.

## Repository Scope

This GitHub release contains the pipeline files directly at repository root. The anonymized data required by the demos is included under `data/`; earlier modeling experiments are not part of this release.

Recommended local layout:

```

Runtime commands should be executed from the repository root.

## Features

- **Single-patient analysis:** Loads one bilateral BBT recording and processes `dom-active` and `ndom-active` sessions separately.
- **Schema validation:** Checks that uploaded or local CSV files match the expected accelerometer schema.
- **Signal preprocessing:** Computes ENMO, zero-phase Y/Z Butterworth bandpass filtering, jerk magnitude, and sliding windows.
- **Artifact exclusion:** Removes gross movements using iterative robust thresholds over 0.5 s, 1 s, and 2 s scales.
- **Interpretable features:** Uses asymmetry, bilateral synchrony, jerk correlation, ENMO peak, and jerk RMS.
- **Intra-patient detectors:** Fits robust quantile, Isolation Forest, and PCA reconstruction detectors on each patient's calm windows.
- **Median ensemble:** Combines detector scores with a conservative median aggregation.
- **Composite MM rule:** Applies explicit score, asymmetry, synchrony, artifact, and boundary criteria.
- **Patient-level geometry:** Reports a dispersion ratio on the `(asymmetry_index, xcorr_max)` plane as secondary evidence.
- **Streamlit webapp:** Provides demo-patient loading, one-patient CSV upload, event inspection, signal zooms, and scatter plots.
- **Reproducible EDA scripts:** Regenerates sprint figures, ablations, CSV summaries, and the final project report.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** Core implementation language.
- **NumPy:** Numerical array operations.
- **Pandas:** CSV loading, validation, and tabular feature processing.
- **SciPy:** Butterworth filtering, zero-phase filtering, and signal utilities.
- **scikit-learn:** Isolation Forest, PCA reconstruction, robust preprocessing utilities, and evaluation helpers.
- **Matplotlib:** Static sprint figures.
- **Plotly:** Interactive webapp charts.
- **Streamlit:** Single-patient decision-support interface.

## Sources and Data

No external API is required by the explainable pipeline.

The anonymized dataset is included in `data/`. By default, `config.py` resolves data paths relative to the repository root:

```text
data/UpdatedData/ucp/bbt_ucp_raw_anon.csv
data/UpdatedData/td/bbt_td_raw_anon.csv
```

The expected raw CSV schema is:

```text
Accelerometer X
Accelerometer Y
Accelerometer Z
datetime
hand
hand_dominance
type
hand_type
session
hand_label
id
```

Expected categorical values:

| Column           | Values        | Meaning                                |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `type`           | `ucp`, `td`   | Cohort label in the source dataset     |
| `hand_type`      | `dom`, `ndom` | Dominant or non-dominant hand identity |
| `session`        | `dom`, `ndom` | Hand active during the BBT session     |
| `hand`           | `L`, `R`      | Anatomical hand                        |
| `hand_dominance` | `L`, `R`      | Patient dominant hand                  |

For webapp uploads, the CSV must contain exactly one patient id. Both `dom` and `ndom` sessions are recommended; at least one valid bilateral session is required.

## Method

The final pipeline follows this sequence:

1. Load a bilateral BBT recording for one patient.
2. Split the recording into `dom-active` and `ndom-active` sessions.
3. Compute per-hand ENMO:

```text
ENMO(t) = max(sqrt(ax^2 + ay^2 + az^2) - 1, 0)
```

4. Apply a zero-phase fourth-order Butterworth bandpass on Y/Z axes over 0.5-15 Hz.
5. Compute jerk magnitude from the bandpassed Y/Z signals.
6. Build 1 s windows with 50% overlap.
7. Detect gross motor artifacts with iterative `median + 7*MAD` thresholds at 0.5 s, 1 s, and 2 s scales.
8. Extract the selected feature vector:

```text
asymmetry_index
xcorr_max
bilateral_jerk_corr
enmo_peak
jerk_mag_rms
```

9. Fit three detectors on the patient's calm windows:

```text
robust quantile detector
Isolation Forest
PCA reconstruction detector
```

10. Combine detector scores with the median ensemble.
11. Apply the final MM-candidate rule.
12. Compute the patient-level dispersion ratio as a secondary indicator.

## Final MM-Candidate Rule

A window is marked as `is_mm_candidate` when:

```text
score_median >= 0.70
AND asymmetry_index <= 0.60
AND xcorr_max >= 0.40
AND not is_artifact
AND not is_boundary
```

Where:

| Field             | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `score_median`    | Median score from the robust quantile, Isolation Forest, and PCA reconstruction detectors               |
| `asymmetry_index` | Signed energy asymmetry between active and still hand                                                   |
| `xcorr_max`       | Maximum bilateral cross-correlation within the configured lag range                                     |
| `is_artifact`     | Gross movement flag used as an exclusion mask                                                           |
| `is_boundary`     | First and last 3 seconds of each session, excluded because of BBT setup/cleanup and filter edge effects |

The selected cutoffs were chosen by grid ablation on the available cohort:

```text
sensitivity UCP = 82.4%
specificity TD = 89.3%
Youden J = 0.716
```

## Patient-Level Dispersion Indicator

The package computes a geometric dispersion ratio on the `(asymmetry_index, xcorr_max)` plane:

```text
dispersion_ratio = dispersion_ndom / dispersion_dom
```

This value is displayed in the webapp as secondary patient-level evidence. It is not a hard filter in the window-level MM rule.

## Getting Started

The commands below assume the layout described in `Repository Scope` and are executed from the repository root.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer.
- Access to the anonymized BBT CSV files listed in `Sources and Data`.
- A shell running from the repository root.

### Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment from the repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the minimal runtime dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Webapp

Start Streamlit from the repository root:

```bash
streamlit run webapp/app.py
```

The app supports:

- Selecting demo patients from the local anonymized dataset.
- Uploading a one-patient CSV.
- Viewing MM-candidate counts by session.
- Inspecting event-level explanations.
- Viewing a 2 s signal zoom around a selected event.
- Comparing session scatter plots on the `(asymmetry_index, xcorr_max)` plane.

An upload-ready test file is available at:

```text
data/upload_examples/ucp5_webapp_upload.csv
```

Expected output for UCP5:

```text
dom  -> 0 MM candidates
ndom -> 13 MM candidates
dispersion_ratio -> about 1.78
```

### Reproducing Sprint Outputs

Run the sprint scripts from the repository root:

```bash
python -m eda.explore
python -m eda.preprocess_demo
python -m eda.artifact_demo
python -m eda.feature_demo
python -m eda.detector_demo
python -m eda.mm_rule_ablation
python -m eda.scatter_dispersion_demo
```

Outputs are written under this folder:

```text

## Issues and Known Constraints

- The final rule is calibrated on the available anonymized cohort and should be revalidated before use on a different acquisition protocol.
- The first and last 3 seconds of each session are excluded from MM-candidate decisions because of setup/cleanup transients and filter edge effects.
- A 60 s BBT recording may not contain visible MM events for every UCP patient.
- TD sessions can contain gross movement artifacts, so the pipeline uses intra-patient baselines instead of a TD-trained anomaly baseline.
- Upload mode accepts one patient id per CSV.
